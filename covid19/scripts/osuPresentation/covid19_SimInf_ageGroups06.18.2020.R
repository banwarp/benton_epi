# changes from covid19_SimInf_06.16.2020.R
# Added in functionality to represent different age groups. 0-17; 18-29, 30-64, 65+
# This will allow for different mixing rates, different hospitalization rates; different mortality rates, etc.
# Removed natural birth rate and death rate to cut down on number of transitions
# Removed the random assignment of S0 to nodes; everything is uniform
# updated hospitalization and death rates and factors based on OHA data as of 9/1/2020

# changes from covid19_SimInf_06.06.2020.R
# Added in functionality to represent variable transmission rates: 80% of new infections caused by 20% of infectious; 20% of new caused by 80%, with variability

# changes from covid19_SimInf_05.30.2020.R
# Added post-infectious compartment to represent monitoring symptoms. Post infectious captures all exposed and a proportion of infectious.
# Added unknown-infectious compartment to represent infections that remain unknown
# Changed pts_function to calculate prevalence based only on post-infectious (i.e. observed infections).
# Removed Rtee from local data since it is too hard to calculate exactly and can be reproduced from phi and global R0I, R0P, R0U.
# Added option to pass data frames for different events into the function instead of always using the built in data frame build
# Added option to plot different percentiles instead of just median
# updated kbDates to reflect reality (phase 1 on 5/15, phase 2 on 6/05, moved up phase 3 to anticipated 7/03)
# updated kbPhase = 1 to reflect starting 6/01/2020 in phase 1
# updated simDate = "2020-06-01"
# added kbPhase parameter to allow for updated phase of reopening

# changes from covid19_SimInf_5.16.2020.R
# Changed the parachute distribution function from a janky chi-square to beta distribution with user-defined shape parameters.
# Removed limit on number of trials
# Added an option for uniform distribution of initial susceptibles among all nodes in a trial

# changes from covid19_SimInf_5.14.2020.R
# Added option to choose which nodeGroups get initial infectious and to limit parachuter/super-spreader/massEntry events to certain nodeGroups

# changes from covid19_SimInf_5.12.2020.R
# Added node groups to represent structured sub-populations (e.g. cities, communities with higher mixing, etc.)
# Fixed error in initial distribution of infectious - old versions distributed uniformly instead of according to maxInodeProp

# changes from covid19_SimInf_5.10.2020.R
# wrapped into a function for more efficient scenario generation

# changes from covid19_SimInf_5.8.2020.R
# added hospitalized compartment
# changed death transition from I -> M to H --> M and I -> M to represent that most fatalities occur in individuals who were hospitalized
# improve external (i.e. node-to-node) transfer algorithm
### add option to cluster nodes (higher inGroupTransferRate within nodes compared to across nodes)

# changes from covid19_SimInf_5.6.2020.R
# added option for a "super spreader" through the events
# changed file name for massEntryEVentFunction script to massEventFunction, and added super spreader function as another function in that script
# added option to plot I+Is to represent all infected individuals

# changes from covid19_SimInf_5.5.200.R
# added isolation = Is compartment that exposed can enter to represent enhanced contact tracing
# added cumulative infections = cumI compartment
# added code to simInfPlottingFunction to show daily new infections
# changed plotting function to be able to plot continuous variables as well as compartments

# changes from covid19_SimInf_5.1.2020.R
# reorganized parameters
#   moved constant parameters from V0 to ldata if they varied across trial
#   moved constant parameters from v0/ldata to gdata/pts_function parameters if they didn't vary across trial
#   requires significant changes in pts_fun
# added in pdDecay - decay parameter to represent the slow decay of physical distancing as people return to normal interactions
# added confidence interval parameter for plotting different spreads

# changes from covid19_SimInf_4.30.2020.R
# changed R0 and infectiousPeriod to match IDM 4/22 data
# increased baseline phi to represent impact of physical distancing and contact tracing even in absence of interventions
# created parmsList to organize parameters

# changes from covid19_SimInf_4.24.2020.R
# Split phiMovement into an up movement and a down movement, which seems more realistic to me.

# changes from covid19_SimInf_4.24.2020.R
# Starting simulation with high intervention to match reality, using continuous variable KB in pts_function

# changes from covid19_SimInf_4.23.2020.R
# adding local data for beta to introduce more variability

# changes from covid19_SimInf_4.18.2020.R
# moved pts_fun to a separate script for space and annotation
# added more massEntry functionality
# added local data parameters for more variability

# changes from covid19_SimInf_4.9.2020.R
# removed all the efforts before Effort 15
