# pts_funScript_school_07.04.2020.R

# changes from pts_funScript_school_07.02.2020.R
# Changed quarantine decision process from 1 case leads to quarantine to user-defined number of cases leads to quarantine
# Removed false positives - too complex for right now
# Fixed error in detection rates
# Added counters for number of isolated in classroom;grade;school for post-run inspection of results

# changes from pts_funScript06.30.2020.R
# Removed Infection Timer
# Added false positives

# changes from pts_funScript06.25.2020.R
# added functionality for multiple school times, days, breaks

# changes from pts_funScript06.16.2020.R
# Removed phi and associated code
# Added evening and weekend continuous variables
# Added functionality for quarantining a classroom

# changes from pts_funScript06.09.2020.R
# Added in highSpreadProp randomizer for each time step to represent variability in transmissibility between individuals
# Fixed the defaults in pts_funScript to reflect that parmsList is deprecated.
# added H for calculating community prevalence
# Fixed error in summing compartments for community prevalence - forgot to exclude cumI from denominator

# changes from pts_funScript5.5.2020.R
# Use pI for prevalence, since I and uI are by definition not detectd.

# changes from pts_funScript5.2.2020.R
# revised the neighbor algorithm to be more efficient on the front(R)-end


# changes from pts_funScript5.1.2020.R
# reorganized parameters
#   moved constant parameters from V0 to ldata if they varied across trial
#   moved constant parameters from v0/ldata to gdata/pts_function parameters if they didnt vary across trial
# added Rt tracker
# added in pdDecay - decay parameter to represent the slow decay of physical distancing as people return to normal interactions


# changes from pts_funScript.R
# removed baytat
# increased baseline phi to represent impact of physical distancing and contact tracing
# changed defaults for cosAmp, prevType, upDelay, downDelay, switchOffPolicies, switchOffDay, phiMoveUp, phiMoveDown
