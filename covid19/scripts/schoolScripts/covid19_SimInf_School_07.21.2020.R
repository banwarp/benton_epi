# changes from covid19_SimInf_School_07.04.2020.R
# Updated parameters to most recent literature
# Sources: 

# changes from covid19_SimInf_School06.20.2020.R
# Changed pts_fun to let user define the case number for which quarantine is started.
# Removed false positives - too complex for right now

# changes from covid19_SimInf_06.16.2020.R
# Major changes from the base script
# Model schools instead of mixed populations
# Added preSymptomatic, Symptomatic, post-symptomatic, and asymptomatic compartments.
# stationary and transitory compartments
# Ability to isolate individuals (maybe), classrooms (yes), grades (not yet - based on node groups), and schools (not yet - based on trials)
# Non zero, non-unit probability of detecting pre, symp, post, and asymp infections
# Renamed covidWrapper to covidSimulator
# See covid19_SimInf_06.16.2020.R for history of other changes
